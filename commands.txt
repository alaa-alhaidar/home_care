To install the required dependencies for a Laravel project, such as the one in your `home_care` repository, you'll follow these steps. I'll provide a detailed description and the necessary commands to ensure your Laravel application is properly set up and running.### Step 1: Access Your EC2 InstanceFirst, log in to your EC2 instance where you have cloned the `home_care` repository.```bashssh -i /path/to/your-key.pem ubuntu@your-ec2-instance-ip```### Step 2: Navigate to Your Project DirectoryOnce you're logged in, navigate to the directory where you cloned the `home_care` repository.```bashcd /var/www/home_care```### Step 3: Install PHP and Necessary ExtensionsLaravel requires PHP and some specific extensions. Ensure that PHP is installed along with the necessary extensions.```bashsudo apt updatesudo apt install php php-mbstring php-xml php-bcmath php-json php-zip php-mysql unzip -y```### Step 4: Install ComposerComposer is a dependency manager for PHP, which Laravel uses to manage its packages.1. Download and install Composer:    ```bash    curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php    ```2. Move the Composer binary to a global location:    ```bash    sudo mv composer.phar /usr/local/bin/composer    ```### Step 5: Install Laravel DependenciesWith Composer installed, you can now install the necessary dependencies for your Laravel project.1. Run the following command in the `home_care` project directory:    ```bash    composer install    ```   This will download and install all dependencies specified in the `composer.json` file.### Step 6: Set File PermissionsLaravel needs specific permissions for certain directories like `storage` and `bootstrap/cache`.1. Set the correct permissions:    ```bash    sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/home_care    sudo chmod -R 775 /var/www/home_care/storage /var/www/home_care/bootstrap/cache    ```### Step 7: Set Up the Environment FileThe `.env` file contains configuration settings for your application. Since you've already generated an `APP_KEY` locally, ensure it is correctly set on your EC2 instance.1. If necessary, upload the `.env` file from your local machine to the server, or copy the `APP_KEY` and other settings to the existing `.env` file on the server.   Example:    ```bash    nano /var/www/home_care/.env    ```   Paste your settings, particularly the `APP_KEY`.### Step 8: Generate Application Key (if not done locally)If you haven't already generated the application key on your local machine, do it now:```bashphp artisan key:generate```This command sets the `APP_KEY` in your `.env` file.### Step 9: Run Database MigrationsIf your application requires a database, run the migrations to set up the database schema.```bashphp artisan migrate```### Step 10: Set Up Your Web Server (Apache/Nginx)Assuming you are using Apache or Nginx, you need to configure your web server to serve the Laravel application.For Apache, ensure the following configuration:```bashsudo nano /etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf```Update the `DocumentRoot` to point to the `public` directory of your Laravel project:```apacheDocumentRoot /var/www/home_care/public```Enable mod_rewrite and restart Apache:```bashsudo a2enmod rewritesudo systemctl restart apache2```For Nginx, you would create a configuration file pointing to the `public` directory and restart Nginx.### Step 11: Access Your ApplicationFinally, ensure your application is running by accessing it via the public IP address or domain name of your EC2 instance.```bashhttp://your-ec2-instance-ip```### Summary of CommandsHere’s a quick summary of the key commands:1. **Update system and install PHP:**    ```bash    sudo apt update    sudo apt install php php-mbstring php-xml php-bcmath php-json php-zip php-mysql unzip -y    ```2. **Install Composer:**    ```bash    curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php    sudo mv composer.phar /usr/local/bin/composer    ```3. **Install Laravel dependencies:**    ```bash    composer install    ```4. **Set permissions:**    ```bash    sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/home_care    sudo chmod -R 775 /var/www/home_care/storage /var/www/home_care/bootstrap/cache    ```5. **Generate app key:**    ```bash    php artisan key:generate    ```6. **Run migrations:**    ```bash    php artisan migrate    ```With these steps, your Laravel project should be up and running on your EC2 instance.
